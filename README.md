# Sentimental
My Python implementation of a couple of programs I made previously using C in the CS50 course.

1. **Marioless**

   Takes user input as pyramid's height and forms one side of a pyramid with spaces and hashes in accordance to the given height.

2. **Mariomore**

   Takes user input as pyramid's height and forms a pyramid with spaces and hashes in accordance to the given height.

3. **Cash**

   Cash is an implementation of Greedy algorithm. The user inputs how much change is owed then the program prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.

4. **Caesar**

   Caesar is an encryption program. It takes a plaintext and converts it to a ciphertext using encryption. The program takes a command-line argument from the user as the key to be used to implement Caesar's cipher for encryption. Afterwards, the program takes a message from the user as the plaintext. Then, it encrypts the plaintext using Caesar's cipher with the key inputted earlier by the user. This will convert the plaintext to ciphertext, then the program prints out the ciphertext.
