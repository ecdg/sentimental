# Sentimental
My Python implementation of a couple of programs I made previously using C in the CS50 course.

1. **Marioless**

   Takes user input as pyramid's height and forms one side of a pyramid with spaces and hashes in accordance to the given height.

2. **Mariomore**

   Takes user input as pyramid's height and forms a pyramid with spaces and hashes in accordance to the given height.

3. **Cash**

   Cash is an implementation of Greedy algorithm. The user inputs how much change is owed then the program prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.
   
   
   [Documentation](https://docs.cs50.net/2019/x/psets/6/sentimental/cash/cash.html) for [cash.py](https://github.com/emilyd17/sentimental/blob/master/sentimental/cash.py)
   
   
4. **Caesar**

   Caesar is an encryption program. It encrypts messages using Caesar's cipher.
